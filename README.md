## Wallet Transfers

Users are able to send and receive USDC from their wallets to other wallets. This is done by Logging into the app and clicking your balance
at the bottom to take you to the transaction screen where you can send USDCÂ or ETH. Please make sure that You are on the same network as the
person you are sending USDCÂ to or else the transaction would fail. But first we need faucets ðŸ˜Ž

## Wallet Recovery

Have you forgotten your wallet transfer pin? no worries you can recover it back by logging into the app and resetting it to something else. I think this feature is great for those that easily forget or don't want the burden or remembering pins.
